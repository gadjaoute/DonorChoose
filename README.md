Machine learning project funding prediction for Donors Choose
DonorsChoose is a non-profit organization that facilitates donations
to classroom projects for public schools within the US. This analysis
utilized two datasets with records from 2015-2016, which can be
downloaded directly from the company website. A random sample
of 50,000 projects data and their application essays were used to
predict whether a project was funded or not, using different projects
and text features. Our results show that with Neural Network model, if a project
would be funded could be predicted with an 65%. accuracy.
